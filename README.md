# Finger Count

Simple calculator built with OpenCV and Python3 that uses one hand gestures as input for the calculations. 

Ran from `FingerCount.py`.

#BASE IDEA
# Simple calculator with input parsed from hand gestures
# Small interval to combine numbers (wait until combine sign)

## TODO
### Following gestures:
* `0-5 numbers` (0 as "ok"-sign or similar)
* fist for `COMBINE` gesture, e.g. 3+5 = 8 - parsed with some small interval 3s, or something
* something as `+ & -` gestures
* something as `/ & * ` gestures
* `NEXT` gesture, e.g. 3 -> "next" -> 6 = 36
* something as `CALCULATE` gesture
* `RESET` and `REWIND` gestures

## BASE IDEA
* Simple calculator with input parsed from hand gestures.
* Small interval to combine numbers (wait until `COMBINE` sign).
